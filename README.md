### AIoT-FallDetectionCNN1D

This repository contains the implementation of an AIoT-based fall detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on wearable devices. Falls are a significant public health issue, causing severe injuries and even deaths worldwide. The proposed system aims to efficiently and effectively detect fall incidents by leveraging deep learning techniques through CNN.

The system combines IoT technology, machine learning algorithms, and Telegram bot interface. It utilizes wearable devices equipped with sensors to collect data, which is then processed and analyzed using CNN for accurate detection. The system's performance was evaluated, achieving an overall accuracy of 94.33% and a validation accuracy of 83.33%.

By implementing this AIoT-based fall detection system, it is expected to improve the efficiency of detecting fall incidents in at-risk individuals, especially in situations where direct supervision is not feasible. The system has the potential to prevent serious injuries, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the quality of life for individuals vulnerable to falling incidents.
